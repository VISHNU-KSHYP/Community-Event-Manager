## Project Title
Community Event Manager (Solidity Smart Contract)

## Project Description
The Community Event Manager is a decentralized smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows individuals to create, manage, and complete community events, with rewards distributed to event organizers upon successful completion. This contract ensures transparency, accountability, and secure transactions for both event managers and participants. 

The contract allows managers to create events, set rewards, and mark events as completed, ensuring that the rewards are distributed only after the event is successfully concluded. Managers can also withdraw their earnings securely.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Community Event Manager is to streamline event organization in a decentralized manner, providing event managers with a secure platform to create events with rewards. This will enable community-driven activities without relying on centralized intermediaries. By using blockchain technology, the project aims to offer a transparent and reliable environment where managers are rewarded based on the completion of their events.

## Key Features

- **Create Events**: Anyone can create a community event by providing a name, description, date, and a reward amount. The reward amount must be sent along with the transaction to fund the event.
  
- **Mark Events as Completed**: Only the event manager can mark the event as completed once the event's date has passed. The manager will receive the reward upon completion.

- **Withdraw Earnings**: Event managers can withdraw their earned rewards after successfully completing their events.

- **Event Tracking**: All events are stored on the blockchain with details including event name, description, date, manager, reward amount, and completion status. This provides full transparency for participants.

- **Security & Transparency**: All interactions, such as event creation and completion, are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, accountability, and security.
